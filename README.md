## [Download](https://github.com/loganout/DBD_Killer_Vote_4_Twitch/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

## How to log in
* Create an account for your Bot if you don't already have one;
* Add your Bot account username (Ex: adenabot);
* Add the name of your Twitch channel (Ex: loganout);
* Log in with your bot's Twitch account;
* To get the authentication password (OAuth), go to: https://twitchapps.com/tmi/

## How to use
After logging in, the START, RESET buttons will appear, as well as a green screen.

By clicking the **START** button, you will allow your chat participants to vote for the desired killer.

The **RESET** button erases from the database all records of the last or current vote. **This process is irreversible.**

Click the **STOP** button to stop or pause the current voting.

Participants in your chat will be able to vote by entering the **number** for each killer.

Each participant is only able to vote once, until the time of development.

## Development
Goal is to develop a Bot with minigames and a lot to make the chat more interactive. I count on suggestions and incentives.
