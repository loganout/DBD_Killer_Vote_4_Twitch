## How to use
After logging in, the START, RESET buttons will appear, as well as a green screen.

By clicking the **START** button, you will allow your chat participants to vote for the desired killer.

The **RESET** button erases from the database all records of the last or current vote. **This process is irreversible.**

Click the **STOP** button to stop or pause the current voting.

Participants in your chat will be able to vote by entering the **number** for each killer.

Each participant is only able to vote once, until the time of development.
